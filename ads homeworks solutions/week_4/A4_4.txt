(D) based on the answers of (b) & (c)
i think the best choice of k would be a small value like 100
due to the results being pretty conststant after that value in the plotting 
leading to no significatnt imporuvement of performence.
as it allows Insertion Sort to handle small subarrays 
efficiently while maintaining the overall efficiency of Merge Sort.
