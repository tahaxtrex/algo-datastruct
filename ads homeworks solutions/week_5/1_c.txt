Yes, for all 4 methods all the functions will return the same fibonacci number
althought the aproach is differant, but the reasoning behind is roughly the same,
aside from the golden number's one which was just prouven to be given similar values
if not a lot of data is lost in the process. The rest all follow the same process of 
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
