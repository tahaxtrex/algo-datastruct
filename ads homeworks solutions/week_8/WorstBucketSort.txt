the worst time complexity of the bucket sort algorithm is all 
depeinding on the time complexity of the sorting algorithm used
to sort each bucket, as each algorithm differs.

the forrmula for the time complexity of the bucket sort is:
T(n) = O'(n) + the sum going from 0 to the number of buckets of the worst
time complexity of the sorting algorithm used to sort the buckets

in the case of insertion sort : O(n²)
if quick sort for instance : O(n log n)

an Exemple of that would be if the numbers given to sort are not
nicely spread on the buckets, but instead all put in the same bucket
making it more depending on the sorting algorithm for the bucket :
since all the other buckets are empty we only focus on the one that
contains the elements of the array to sort, and since it's the worst case
this would be done in O(n²) in the exemple of insertion sort
