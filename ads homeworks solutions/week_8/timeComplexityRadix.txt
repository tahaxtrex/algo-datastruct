the time complexity of the radix sort algorithm depends on 2 arguments,
the number n of elements in the array, and the number d of digits in the
max element of that array, and since we go through each digit from 1 to d
of all the number of the array the time complexity of the msd radix sort is
Ö(n*d)

the second part is used with chat gpt : 

for the space complexity :
Since elements are only moved, not duplicated, we don’t use n × d space
The space usage is not additive across recursive calls,
and for each number a digit can take which is 10 we allocate a bucket
because elements are partitioned the space complexity is:
Ö(n + d * 10)
